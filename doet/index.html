    <h1>The Design of Asus Monitor</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        The monitor I used to cast contents from my laptop has many amazing
        features, but there are also some features that are not straight forward
        for the users to understand with a simple glance. There might be a few
        reasons for this, i.e, the the designers of the product might thik the
        end users of their products are tech savy, although tech savy people
        widely use monitors, they are not the only one's who use computers to
        perfom their day to day tasks. older people, or other groups of the
        society might use this technology so it should be very user friendly and
        very descriptive.

      <p>
        Unfortunatley my ASUS monitor is amongst the product that failed to meet
        usablity because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The product has one Type-c port and three buttons, but only the power
          button has a discriptive sign is next to it.
        </li>
        <li>It doesn't have easy access to adjust screen brightness.</li>
        <li>
          If users run into connectivity issue, its hard to find customized
          troubleshooting tools on the company website.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
