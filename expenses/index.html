          Spreadsheet is one of the way people use to manage their financial
          transactions. Trinity and Neo also uses Spreadsheet to keep track of
          their credit card purchase on their joint and individual credit cards.
          while observing Trinity and Neo's spreadsheet I found some interesting
          usablity problems associated with Learnablity, efficiency and safety.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px">
          Lets look Learnablity first. As an external person looking into their
          spreadsheet It took me a while to understand the structures of it.
          Although each column is labled, its not direct and clear for an
          outsider. They also might get confused whey they look back to it after
          a while. Besides labeling, the fact items are not ordered in
          alphabetical order makes it disturbing and difficult to find a
          specific expense. if the expenses were arranged in a certain order it
          will help to understand it better. The same problem can also be
          assesed from efficiency and safetey perspectives.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px">
          The last but not the least Usability problem observed was safety. if
          Trinty or Neo have made a mistake on inputing an expense then it's not
          easy to spot the mistake. From the safety aspect, its crucial to
          prevent error or spot it quickly before damage happened. If we see the
          big picture in the aspects big financial companies such a small
          mistake could lead to a huge financial loss.
