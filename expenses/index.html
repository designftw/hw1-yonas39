          Spreadsheet is widely known method to keep track of finanical
          transactions. Although it is a great tool, its not easily
          understandable by some users. Inaddition, when the number of input
          items grow it will become tidious to keep track of activities.

          Although spreadsheet is a great way of managing financial
          transactions, In the case of Trinity and Neo Spreadsheet, I observed
          some usablity problems i.e, learnablity, efficiency and safety.
          Forexample, if Trinty or Neo have made a mistake on labling an expense
          correctley then it's not easy to spot the mistake. According to safety
          aspects of usablity error prevention or immidiate detection are
          important to reduce the assiciated risk otherwise it could lead to
          monetary loss. learnablity is also the biggest issue that I have
          noticed in the Spreadsheet. As seen on the spreadsheet expenses are
          listed in a random order which makes it difficult to find a certain
          type of expense, i.e., if the expenses were organized by their
          alphabetical order or the amount of money it would have been easier to
          find a certain item quickley. Due to the above mentioned reason we can
          conclude that the spreadsheet has learniblity and efficiency problems.
